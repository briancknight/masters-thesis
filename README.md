# masters-thesis

This repository contains all code borrowed or created for the purpose of a masters thesis in mathematics focused on the study of convex optimization. The core program is a convex image registration algorithm which follows the construction of Taylor and Bhusnurmath, which can be found here: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-88693-8_47. All implementation is in Python, and various examples can be found in the Taylor08Examples.py with minor manipulation. This is not currently set up for ease of use for those who are unfamiliar with the project -- my apologies.

Also found in this repository is a pdf of the final written thesis, as well as the final thesis beamer presentation in the pdf format.
